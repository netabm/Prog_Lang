# User guide for running the interpreter

### Interactive Mode
Interactive mode allows users to run commands line by line in a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment. This mode is ideal for testing small code snippets, debugging, and experimenting with the language's features.
#### How to Use Interactive Mode:
- **Enter the terminal:** Navigate to the directory “final_project” by entering the following command: “cd final_project”.
- **Start the Interpreter:** Run the interpreter by executing the main.py file without specifying any additional files: “python main.py”.
- **Input Commands:** You can type expressions, function definitions, or any other valid statement directly into the command line.
- **Immediate Feedback:** After pressing Enter, the interpreter evaluates the input and immediately displays the result or output.

### File execution mode
File execution mode is designed for running entire programs written in a .lambda file. This mode is useful for executing complete scripts and programs that have been pre-written and saved.
#### How to Use File Execution Mode:
- **Create a Script:** Write your program in a .lambda file using the language's syntax.
- **Run the Script:** Execute the interpreter by entering the file name as an argument. For example: “python main.py your_program.lambda”.
-	**Program Output:** The interpreter reads the file, evaluates all the statements, and outputs the results.
